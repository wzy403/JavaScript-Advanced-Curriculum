## Lesson 8: Animation Functions with JavaScript (A4 Project)

**Lesson Duration:** ~ 2 hours

### Lesson Goals:
- Deepen understanding of animation timing functions in JavaScript.
- Learn how to create smooth, interactive animations responsive to scrolling and user interaction.
- Apply these concepts practically by completing a scroll-based animation project (A4).

### Part 1: Introduction to Animation Functions (30 min.)

- **Concept Explanation:**
  - What are animation timing functions?
  - How do timing functions affect animation smoothness and realism?
  - Common timing functions: linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, custom functions.
- **Mark up:** 
  - Animation refers to the process by which elements move or change dynamically over time or in response to user actions. 
  - Mastering this technique enables you to create a wide variety of engaging and interactive animations.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```javascript
  function createAnimation(xStart, xEnd, yStart, yEnd) {
    return function (progress) {
      // Custom calculation based on progress
    };
  }
  ```

### Part 2: A4 Interactive Project â€“ Scroll Animation (1 hours)

- **Project Objective:**
  - Create interactive animations triggered by scrolling:
    - Smoothly animate elements in and out based on scroll position.

- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Select and track DOM elements.
  - Implement `createAnimation` function:
    - Dynamically compute styles based on scroll position.
  - Use JavaScript events (`scroll`, `resize`) to update animations in real-time.

- **Key Functions and Logic:**
  ```javascript
  function updateAnimationMap() {
    // Calculate and store animations for each item
  }

  function updateStyles() {
    // Apply animations based on current scroll position
  }
  ```

  - Instructor presents a comprehensive solution, highlighting key aspects:
    - Implementation of dynamic animation calculations.
    - Optimizing animations for performance and fluidity.

- **Discussion Points:**
  - Compare custom animation functions to CSS-based solutions.
