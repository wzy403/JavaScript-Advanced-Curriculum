## Assignment 2: Rewriting Fetch with Promises

**Lesson Duration:** ~ 2 hours

### Assignment Overview
This assignment is designed to deepen your understanding of how asynchronous JavaScript operates, specifically through Promises and async/await, by rewriting a custom fetch function. The objective is to clearly see how Promises underlie modern async/await syntax.

---

### Learning Objectives
- Gain practical experience in handling asynchronous operations with Promises.
- Understand the internal workings of JavaScriptâ€™s fetch API.
- Demonstrate clear knowledge of the relationship between async/await and Promises.

---

### Assignment Tasks (1.5 hours)

### Task 1: Analyze Provided Code
- Carefully examine the provided `code.js`, which currently uses `async/await`:
  ```javascript
  async function getData() {
    const response = await fetch("./data/test.json");
    return await response.json();
  }

  async function foo1() { ... }
  async function foo2() { ... }
  async function foo3() { ... }

  async function main() {
    app.textContent = "Fetching user data...";
    const user = await foo3();
    app.textContent = `User data: ${JSON.stringify(user)}`;
  }

  btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
    main();
  });
  ```
- Understand clearly the flow of asynchronous data retrieval.

### Task 2: Rewrite Using Promises
- Rewrite the provided code without using `async/await`. You must use Promises (`then` and `catch` methods) exclusively.
- Modify the existing functions (`getData`, `foo1`, `foo2`, `foo3`, `main`) to correctly handle Promises.
  ```javascript
  function getData() {
    return fetch("./data/test.json");
  }

  function foo1() { ... }
  function foo2() { ... }
  function foo3() { ... }

  function main() { ... }
  ```

### Task 3: Implement the `run` Function
- Define and implement the `run` function using Promises (`then/catch`) without async/await:
  ```javascript
  function run(func) {
    // Your Promise-based implementation here
  }
  ```
- This function should execute your Promise-based `main` function, correctly handle fetch results, and manage any errors gracefully.

### Task 4: Testing and Validation
- After completing the implementation, uncomment the provided testing line in `replace_await.html`.
- Test thoroughly to confirm correct functionality and robust error handling.

---

### Task up the solution (30 min.)
- Submit the fully functional JavaScript file (`task.js`) with your Promise-based implementation.
- Clearly comment your code, explaining each Promise and handling decision.
- Provide brief written reflections on what you learned about async/await and Promises.
